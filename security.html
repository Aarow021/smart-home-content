                There is no need to fear robbers and criminals, as this house is located far away from any humans! In order for anyone to get to your house, they would have to slog their way through a nuclear wasteland, providing a great deterrance to thieves. In addition, if anyone does make it to the house, the home will detect any tresspassors and shutter the windows!
